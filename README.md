# Advent of Code

My solutions to Advent of Code puzzles from different years. Solving using Java and Kotlin with only their 
standard libraries. No external dependencies are used.

## Project Structure
- Solutions are implemented in Java and Kotlin under:
  - `src/main/java`
  - `src/main/kotlin` 
- All solutions are validated with JUnit tests under:
  - `src/test/java`
  - `src/test/kotlin`
- Input data for the puzzles is stored under the `src/test/resources` directory
- The correct answers for each puzzle are stored in the respective unit tests as expected values in assertions
